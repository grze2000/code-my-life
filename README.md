# Code my life

Code my life is a project inspired by the popular Draw my life initiative, where people tell the story of their life using drawing or computer animation.
I decided to use programming instead and tell a little more about my adventure with computer science.
[Check it out](https://codemylife.grzegorzbabiarz.com/) to find out more about me!

Creating this project I also wanted to practice vector graphics and learn how to apply it and animations on websites using GSAP.
